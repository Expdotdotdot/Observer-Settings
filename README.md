# Observer-Settings
My regular observer settings for consistency

## HLAE is recommended
https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx

## Faceit Coaches
Use the command --> spec_player <-- followed by the player name in "" to spectate the player that is not on 0-9

Ex: bind 9 spec_player "VeryCoolUsername"

Alternatively, if you are using HLAE, you can print the player slots in your console with this command --> "mirv_deathmsg help players"

(Note that HLAE counts from 0 so you will have to +1 to the slot number)

OR you can use Chezpuf's observer rebind tool: https://github.com/Chezpuf/observer-bind-tool

OR OR you can use paper's HLAE fork that comes with an overlay: https://github.com/papesgit/advancedfx
