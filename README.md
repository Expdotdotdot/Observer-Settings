My regular observer settings for consistency

# HLAE is recommended

# Faceit Coaches
Use spec_player followed by the player name in "" to spec the player that is not on 0-9

Ex: bind - spec_player "VeryCoolUsername"

Alternatively, if you are using HLAE you can print the player slots in your console with the command "mirv_deathmsg help players"

Note that HLAE counts from 0 so you will have to +1 to the slot number
