# Observer-Settings
My regular observer settings for consistency

## HLAE is recommended
https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx

## Faceit Coaches
- **This command must be set to 0 --> *spec_usenumberkeys_nobinds***

- Use the command --> *spec_player* followed by the player name in "quotations" to spectate the player that is not on 0-9

  > Ex: bind 9 spec_player "VeryCoolUsername"
  
  > Note that if a player's name starts with a number, this WILL NOT WORK 

- Alternatively, if you are using HLAE, you can print the player slot numbers in your console with this command --> "mirv_deathmsg help players"

  > Ex: bind 9 spec_player 11

  > (Note that HLAE counts from 0 so you will have to +1 to the slot number)
